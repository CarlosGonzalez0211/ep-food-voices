    "description": "Patricia Palafox Sweisford, a native of El Paso, shares how she has gone from growing up eating mostly canned food, to discovering a passion for healthy, fresh quality food and wine while traveling through Europe. Her passion for food grew to the degree that after retirement from teaching, she enrolled at El Paso Community College’s Culinary Arts program. Her story addresses what she sees as a changing phase of culinary options in El Paso where fresh food, quality dining and good wine is becoming part of El Paso’s landscape.",

The recipes for these demonstrations are gathered from the first cookbook published in El Paso by the Ladies’ Auxiliary for YMCA.

    "description": "Christopher Puga became the culinary arts instructor at Bowie High School and quickly built the Oso’ Good Catering and Food Truck program with the assistance of his students. Before becoming a successful and impactful culinary arts teacher, Chef Puga enjoyed cooking and was inspired by reality television shows and cooking competitions. He baked his first cake as a child, and while it may not have been up to his present day standards, he realized that he had a passion for making art with his hands. Upon beginning his teaching career, Chef Puga was surprised to find a budding program that had come into fruition through Bowie High School’s Class of 2017’s hard work. A committed group of students and Chef Puga built a curriculum from the ground up centered around the food truck, which they called the Oso’ Good Food Truck and Catering. As the program took off, the food truck and catering program grew in popularity.",

As a young teenager, Luis’s grandfather sent him on a bus to New York where he would later receive training in the culinary arts. Following his graduation, cooking took Luis around the world and back to El Paso, Texas, where he worked at many local restaurants. After Luis suffered a heart attack on the job, he sought a life where he can still do work he enjoyed without the stress of a busy kitchen. That’s when he found the Borderland Rainbow Center. There, Luis began volunteering at the food pantry, and since then has found a new family and purpose - serving El Paso’s various communities through food.",

Throughout his story, he references his “church family,” which is a close knit group of friends Robert has made through activities at St. Pius X. It is through his many families that he has learned the value of sharing and caring for one another, something that food has communicated throughout his life.",

    "description": "Leticia, better known as Lety, and her husband, Miguel Hernandez acquired The Sausage Shop, located at 3903 Tompkins Street, El Paso, Texas in January 2007. But they had been part of its history and operation much earlier. Joseph Hryszko, the original owner, was Lety’s sister’s father-in-law. Joe was born in Harrison, New Jersey, and joined the US Army at age 18. He attended boot camp in El Paso and fell in love with the city, the culture, and the people. Over his career, he was stationed at Ft. Bliss several times, and early on knew this is where he would retire. Joe was the first generation from his family to make El Paso his home along with his wife Clarita and four children. He lived approximately 50 years in El Paso, TX, until his passing, August 6, 2010. The Sausage Shop, however, remains a family business. Lety and Miguel’s family members, sons, grandchildren, niece and nephew have been part of the daily operation of The Sausage Shop. The Hernandez continue making many of the sausages Joe made, but have added their own creations: Pico de Gallo; Roasted Garlic/Jalapeno; Jalapeno Cheddar; Bacon Brat; Bacon, Cheddar Brats and a Habanero Cheese Dip. They, on a number of occasions, have (and will) prepare special family recipes, for example, South African Boerewors, Argentine Chorizo, and Pinklewurst.",

    "description": "Marion Christina Rohrleitner came to El Paso to work as a literature professor in the Department of English at the University of Texas at El Paso in 2005. In her food story, she shares the history and mixture of cultures that have made Austrian foodways, for her, into a “mutt cuisine.” She also shares the new flavors the Mexican and Southwest foods have added to her culinary palate and that of some of her family and Austrian friends, such as Hatch Green Chiles from New Mexico, pecans, avocados (while accessible in Austria, her mother didn’t like them and they were too expensive to get there), tamales, and cactus. Hosting at home and learning new recipes is central to Marion’s culinary story.",

    "description": "Chef and restaurant owner Raúl Gonzalez, better known as Chef Rulis, claims that where we eat matters less than who makes the food. As a young man, he experienced no difference between eating in Quito, Ecuador or El Paso, Texas, because his mother’s hands prepared and served the food. Despite the change in available ingredients, the flavors of home continued to be defined by his mother. Rulis’ story shows us how a person’s sazón can define and anchor our identities to food.",

With her coffee truck, Calvi, she forms part of this spirit.",
